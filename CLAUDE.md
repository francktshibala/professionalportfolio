## NEXT TASK: 5B - API Development (60 min)

### TASK 5B: API Development - READY TO START ‚è≥

**GOAL:** Create comprehensive RESTful API endpoints for dynamic content management

**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
üîÑ API Endpoints:
   - Projects API: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /api/projects
   - Blog Posts API: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /api/blog
   - Skills API: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /api/skills
   - Contact API: POST /api/contact (enhanced)
   - Analytics API: GET, POST /api/analytics

üîÑ CRUD Operations:
   - Create operations with validation
   - Read operations with pagination and filtering
   - Update operations with partial updates
   - Delete operations with soft deletes
   - Bulk operations for admin efficiency

üîÑ Authentication & Security:
   - API key authentication for admin operations
   - Rate limiting for public endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Error handling and logging
   - CORS configuration

üîÑ Data Integration:
   - Migrate static data to database
   - Update components to use API endpoints
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Add real-time data synchronization

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] All API endpoints return proper JSON responses
- [ ] CRUD operations work correctly with database
- [ ] Frontend components successfully consume API data
- [ ] Authentication protects admin operations
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors maintained
- [ ] API documentation created
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements

**NEXT:** Task 5C - Admin Dashboard

## Architecture Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Component-based architecture
- Performance budget: <3s load time
- Zero TypeScript errors policy
- Deploy after every major milestone

## Code Standards
- Use ES modules syntax
- Prefer composition over inheritance  
- No verbose comments - self-documenting code
- Test locally before committing

## Important Notes
- Deploy immediately after each micro-task completion
- Clear Claude context between micro-tasks
- Update TODO.md progress after each session
- Follow exact version pinning strategy
