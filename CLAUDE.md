   - Configure build settings
   - Deploy to production URL
   - Verify deployment succeeds

3. Test production deployment:
   - Test live URL functionality
   - Check responsive design on mobile/desktop
   - Verify dark/light mode toggle
   - Test navigation between pages
   - Check all interactive elements

4. Document and finalize:

- No console errors on production

**NEXT:** After 1E â†’ Day 2 Planning

## Architecture Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Component-based architecture
- Performance budget: <3s load time
- Zero TypeScript errors policy
- Deploy after every major milestone

## Code Standards
- Use ES modules syntax
- Prefer composition over inheritance  
- No verbose comments - self-documenting code
- Test locally before committing

## Important Notes
- Deploy immediately after each micro-task completion
- Clear Claude context between micro-tasks
- Update TODO.md progress after each session
- Follow exact version pinning strategy

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
