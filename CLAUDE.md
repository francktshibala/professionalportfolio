# Project: professionalportfolio

## Current Phase: Foundation (Day 1)
## Active Micro-Task: 1A - Project Setup

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14.2.x (pinned versions)
- TypeScript 5.3.x (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.x
- Deployment: Vercel

## Current Session Focus
- [ ] Create Next.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] Pin all dependency versions (remove ^ and ~)
- [ ] Configure basic ESLint/Prettier
- [ ] Test local development server
- [ ] Initial git commit and repository setup

## Success Criteria for Current Task
- Local server runs without errors
- TypeScript compiles cleanly
- All dependencies pinned in package.json
- Clean git repository with initial commit

## Architecture Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Component-based architecture
- Performance budget: <3s load time
- Zero TypeScript errors policy
- Deploy after every major milestone

## Code Standards
- Use ES modules syntax
- Prefer composition over inheritance  
- No verbose comments - self-documenting code
- Test locally before committing

## Important Notes
- Deploy immediately after each micro-task completion
- Clear Claude context between micro-tasks
- Update TODO.md progress after each session
- Follow exact version pinning strategy

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
