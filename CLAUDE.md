## Next Phase: 1B - Design System & Core Components

### TASK 1B: Design System & Core Components (30-45 min)

**GOAL:** Create a professional design system with reusable UI components

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Configure Tailwind with custom theme and color palette
- Build core UI components (Button, Card, Container, Typography)
- Implement dark/light mode toggle
- Create proper TypeScript interfaces for all components
- Test components in isolation

**IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:**
1. Configure `tailwind.config.ts` with:
   - Custom color palette (primary, secondary, accent)
   - 8-point grid system (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64px)
   - Typography scale (text-sm to text-4xl)
   - Dark mode configuration

2. Create `src/components/ui/` directory structure:
   - `Button.tsx` - Primary, secondary, ghost variants
   - `Card.tsx` - With shadows and proper spacing
   - `Container.tsx` - Max-width wrapper with responsive padding
   - `Typography.tsx` - H1, H2, H3, P components
   - `ThemeToggle.tsx` - Dark/light mode switcher

3. Add utilities:
   - `src/lib/utils.ts` - For className merging (clsx + tailwind-merge)
   - `src/lib/constants.ts` - For design tokens

4. Create test page to verify all components work

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- All components render correctly
- Dark/light mode toggle works
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Components are properly typed
- Responsive design works on mobile

**NEXT:** After 1B → 1C Navigation & Layout

## Architecture Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Component-based architecture
- Performance budget: <3s load time
- Zero TypeScript errors policy
- Deploy after every major milestone

## Code Standards
- Use ES modules syntax
- Prefer composition over inheritance  
- No verbose comments - self-documenting code
- Test locally before committing

## Important Notes
- Deploy immediately after each micro-task completion
- Clear Claude context between micro-tasks
- Update TODO.md progress after each session
- Follow exact version pinning strategy

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
