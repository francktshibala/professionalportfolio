   - Test database operations
   - Seed initial data

4. Connection & Testing:
   - Configure connection pooling
   - Test CRUD operations
   - Verify data integrity
   - Performance testing

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Database queries execute efficiently
- Prisma schema properly structured
- Migration system works correctly
- Connection pooling configured
- All CRUD operations functional
- Data integrity maintained
- Zero TypeScript errors

**NEXT:** After 5A â†’ Task 5B - API Development

## Architecture Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Component-based architecture
- Performance budget: <3s load time
- Zero TypeScript errors policy
- Deploy after every major milestone

## Code Standards
- Use ES modules syntax
- Prefer composition over inheritance  
- No verbose comments - self-documenting code
- Test locally before committing

## Important Notes
- Deploy immediately after each micro-task completion
- Clear Claude context between micro-tasks
- Update TODO.md progress after each session
- Follow exact version pinning strategy
