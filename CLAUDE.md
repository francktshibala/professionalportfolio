## Current Task: 2B - Animation Framework


### TASK 2B: Animation Framework (45 min) - READY TO START ðŸŽ¯

**GOAL:** Implement smooth animations and micro-interactions to enhance user experience

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Add scroll-triggered animations for section reveals
- Implement hover states and micro-interactions
- Create loading states and skeleton screens
- Add smooth page transitions between routes
- Ensure animations are performant and accessible

**IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:**
1. Scroll Animations:
   - Install framer-motion or use CSS animations
   - Add fade-in animations for sections on scroll
   - Implement stagger animations for card grids
   - Add parallax effects for hero section

2. Micro-interactions:
   - Enhance button hover states with scale/glow effects
   - Add card hover animations with lift and shadow
   - Implement skill bar animations
   - Add typing animation for hero text

3. Loading States:
   - Create skeleton screens for content loading
   - Add loading spinners for form submissions
   - Implement progressive image loading

4. Page Transitions:
   - Add smooth transitions between pages
   - Implement route change animations
   - Add navigation menu animations

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations
- Engaging micro-interactions
- Professional loading states
- Smooth page transitions
- Performant animations (60fps)
- Accessible animations (respects reduced motion)
- Zero TypeScript errors

**NEXT:** After 2B â†’ 2C - Content Strategy

## Architecture Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Component-based architecture
- Performance budget: <3s load time
- Zero TypeScript errors policy
- Deploy after every major milestone

## Code Standards
- Use ES modules syntax
- Prefer composition over inheritance  
- No verbose comments - self-documenting code
- Test locally before committing

## Important Notes
- Deploy immediately after each micro-task completion
- Clear Claude context between micro-tasks
- Update TODO.md progress after each session
- Follow exact version pinning strategy

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
