# Next.js Performance Optimization Tips

Performance is crucial for any modern web application. Here are some essential tips to optimize your Next.js application.

## 1. Image Optimization

Next.js provides built-in image optimization:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/hero-image.jpg"
      alt="Hero"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      priority
    />
  )
}
```

## 2. Dynamic Imports

Use dynamic imports for code splitting:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/heavy-component'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
})
```

## 3. Static Generation

Leverage Static Site Generation (SSG) whenever possible:

```tsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData()
  
  return {
    props: { data },
    revalidate: 60 // ISR
  }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

- Always optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Leverage SSG and ISR for better performance
- Monitor your bundle size regularly
